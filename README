Cloud4All User Profile Editor

A simple script, which reads the json based user profile and makes it editable
by means of a formular on a HTML page. It's written in PHP and was tested under
PHP5 and the web server LightTPD.

Todo: The script cannot parse the nested condition at the moment. So the saving
of the speech-rate does not work.
